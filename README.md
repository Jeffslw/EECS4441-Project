# EECS4441-Project
Final project for EECS4441 Human Computer Interactions. </br>

The project focuses on conducting a usability study comparing different user interface designs: one that follows Don Norman's 7 Principles and another that does not with two levels of input (mouse + keyboard on a desktop/laptop vs touch screen input on a mobile device). </br>
UI prototyping software was developed in Processing and Uizard. </br>
