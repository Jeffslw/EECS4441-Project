# UI Test Usability Study
Final project for EECS4441 Human Computer Interactions. </br>

The project focuses on conducting a usability study comparing different user interface designs: one that follows Don Norman's 7 Principles and another that does not with two levels of input (mouse + keyboard on a desktop/laptop vs touch screen input on a mobile device). </br>

The study involves recruiting 12 participants with diverse backgrounds and assigning them to different groups. The participants were given specific instructions pdfs based on their group and are to complete tasks using both principled and unprincipled user interface designs. </br>
We collected data on task completion time and participants' level of frustration through the testing software and a questionnaire and stored it in our Excel file. 
Based on the results of the study indicate that user interfaces that follow principled design principles outperform those that do not. Participants were able to complete tasks faster and reported lower levels of frustration with principled designs. 

UI prototyping software was developed in Processing and Uizard. </br>

If you would like to try out the prototyping software and don't want to download UITest, there is a Web-based UITest: 
- (Desktop) https://editor.p5js.org/adrianfearman/full/vW4hFQhjA.
- (Mobile) https://editor.p5js.org/adrianfearman/full/6FARgp3xT.

You may follow either Instruction (A) or (B) pdfs.
